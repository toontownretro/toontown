# Contact: Rob Gordon, Edmundo Ruiz (Schell Games)
# Created: October 14, 2009
# Purpose: Base class for a session-based activity with two teams (AI side).
#
#    Note that this class was originally extracted from
#    DistributedPartyTugOfWarActivityAI.py
#===============================================================================
# Config Overrides:
# party-team-activity-single-player bool
#  Allows the dev to run the activity with a single toon playing in it
#
# party-team-activity-start-delay int
#  How long the game should wait before it starts
#
# party-team-activity-duration int
#  How long the Active states lasts in the game
