# Fix up Doodle trait problems.
# Up until toontown_1_0_14_30, pets were assigned traits as if they were bought
# in TTC, regardless of where they were actually bought. This patcher recalcs
# the traits as if the pet was bought in a non-TTC safezone. The choice of
# safezone is based on a metric of how advanced the owner Toon is.
# This process also incidentally fixes several pet traits that were
# accidentally inverted, such that TTC pets are in some respects
# better-behaved than DL pets. This is fixed as a by-product of the way we
# recalculate the pet's traits.
# Also fills in safezone-ID field with a sensible value
