    #                    based on the ratio of toons currently in the
    #                    battle to suits that have *ever* been in the
    #                    battle.  There are six possible combinations
    #                    where a suit might be able to join.
    #
    #                    Starting from the left most entry,
    #                    the first is if the suits outnumber the toons by 2,
    #                    the second is if the suits outnumber the toons by 1,
    #                    the third is if the suits and toons are balanced,
    #                    the fourth is if the toons outnumber the suits by 1,
    #                    the fifth is if the toons outnumber the suits by 2,
    #                    and the last is if the toons outnumber the suits by 3.
    #
    #                    So in general, as toons outnumber suits, the chance of
    #                    new suits joining the battle increases (at least

# history
#
# 22Jan01    jlbutler    created.
# 23Jan01    jlbutler    added code for removing suits and a function
#                        which handles assigning tasks periodically
# 23Jan01    jlbutler    created 'generateTask' and 'think' functions
# 06Feb01    jlbutler    added 'getBattleCellLocation' so others may ask
#                        the suit planner for the location a specific
#                        battle sphere within a specific zone
# 12Feb01    jlbutler    derived SuitPlannerAI from SuitPlannerBase, where
#                        common code that the client might need has been
#                        placed
# 19Feb01    jlbutler    added postBattleResumeCheck which allows the suit
#                        planner to decide if a suit, after it leaves a battle,
#                        should resume it's previous path or if it should
#                        fly away
# 19Apr01    jlbutler    added self.zoneInfo to contain a list of zones
#                        and suits that are currently in those zones, useful
#                        for finding suits in a specific area (also added
#                        function zoneChange(...) to help make it easier to
#                        use the new zone list
# 01May01    jlbutler    added the ability for the suit planner to randomly
#                        pick a suit building for a new suit to exit from,
#                        and the suit will be created with the same track
#                        as the building
