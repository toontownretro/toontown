# history
#
# 21Mar01   jlbutler   created
# 26Mar01   jlbutler   added bonus calculations to suit and toon attacks
# 15Jun01   jlbutler   added 'getAvPropDamage' to calculate the proper damage
#                      for a given prop for a specific toon
# 25Jul01   jnschell   moved 'getAvPropDamage' to ToontownBattleGlobals.py
# 27Jul01   jlbutler   fixed a few bugs with trap and lure and combinations
#                      with other toon attacks
# 27Aug01   jlbutler   Added code to remember statistics about suit attacks
#                      during the course of the entire battle.  Also fixed
#                      a problem where suits would attack dead toons because
#                      they would look randomly for a target in
#                      self.battle.activeToons but this list is not updated
#                      immediately as far as toon deaths go, so instead suits
#                      create a temporary list of active toons that are still
#                      alive when the suit gets around to attacking.
